# Pausing
A template for pausing your game.

## Getting Started
### Requirement
* Godot Engine v3.2+

### Installation
After downloading, open Godot Engine Project Manager. Click Import, go to the folder you've downloaded into, and select "project.godot".

## Usage
### Opening the Project
The editor shows a spinning gear; its animation is resulted by its child node, AnimationTree. Play (F5) the project, and the gear on the new screen should still be spinning. To temporally stop the gear, pause the game. You can do so by clicking on the pause button on the top-left hand corner, or press Esc on the keyboard, which is its key shortcut.

On the pause screen, you can move your mouse to click on one of the buttons, or navigate with arrow keys. Click on them to unpause, or quit (confirmation panel will appear first).
