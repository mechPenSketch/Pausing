# Pausing
A template for pausing your game.

## Getting Started
### Requirement
* Godot Engine v3.2+

### Installation
After downloading, open Godot Engine Project Manager. Click Import, go to the folder you've downloaded into, and select "project.godot".

## Usage
The editor shows a spinning gear; its animation is resulted by its child node, AnimationTree. Play (F5) the project, and press Esc on the keyboard. The gear should stop moving as the Pause Menu pops up. You can navigate the menu to unpause or quit the game.

This asset contains all the files you need to make a functioning pause system.

For more info on how it works and how to apply it to your projects, see the wiki [here](https://github.com/mechPenSketch/Pausing/wiki).
